# UniversalBot
UniversalBot is a discord bot made in python using [discord.py](https://rapptz.github.io/discord.py/docs/index.html). 

Sorry for the lack of files but the bot is currently being rewritten so I'm only pushing the files that have forgone my rewrite process.

### Open-Sourced
UniversalBot is semi-open-sourced under the [Apache License](https://github.com/Lurker-Coding/UniversalBot/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Side-Notes
Just for you to know, the code may be open-sourced but that does not mean portable. The bot heavily dependant on its config file which is not included. The reason for it to be open-sourced is so people can look at its files and figure out how it works. I do not condone hosting it yourself.
